# MetroMate

A project for our college designed using data structures of C++ to simulate a metro system where 
Users can:

* Create an account.
* Purchase three diffrent types of subscriptions.
* Manage thier rides and subscribtions.

Admins can:

* Add, edit, delete user accounts and metro staions.
* Adjust fare rates for different metro stages.
* Simulate trains and handle scheduking.

MetroMate offers a unique blend of functionality, focusing on subscription management, fare calculation, and ride tracking, all through a text-based interface.
