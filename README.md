# Uni-management-system

A project for our college requires the use of a suitable data structure to store different courses and their prerequisites and based on this it will:

* allow any adimn to add students.
* add new course and its requirments.
* edit all course data.

* allow any student to take any course or not.
* show their courses and filter them.
* let the student know his GPA.
